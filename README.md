# Till Financial Static JSON API

For this project, we'll be building a simple web app using React and this static JSON API. With these building blocks we hope to accomplish the following:
- Initialization of a React app
- Fetching of static JSON from this API
- A couple simple user flows

Here are the resources you'll find in this API:

## Users

### GET users
